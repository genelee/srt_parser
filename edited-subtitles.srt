Eat up, the fish
is very fresh today...

18
00:01:23,018 --> 00:02:49,122
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

19
00:01:24,863 --> 00:02:54,248
Never mind, let's sit over here.

20
00:01:29,273 --> 00:03:01,697
It's quite late!

21
00:01:31,318 --> 00:03:05,542
I've just finished work.

22
00:01:33,724 --> 00:03:09,787
What should I call you?

23
00:01:35,207 --> 00:03:13,071
You can call me Mrs. Suen.

24
00:01:36,851 --> 00:03:16,916
- And you?
- My husband's name is Chan.

25
00:01:38,816 --> 00:03:22,763
- Call me when you decide.
- I will.

26
00:01:41,823 --> 00:03:27,008
Did you write down my number?

27
00:01:43,908 --> 00:03:29,571
Yes, I did.

28
00:01:45,151 --> 00:03:33,015
Fine, I'll see you out.

29
00:01:46,835 --> 00:03:38,061
- Don't trouble.
- No trouble!

30
00:01:59,546 --> 00:04:01,129
So it's agreed then!

31
00:02:00,909 --> 00:04:04,092
Thank you very much!
I should go.

32
00:02:02,393 --> 00:04:06,255
- Fine.
- Bye!

33
00:02:03,475 --> 00:04:09,138
Take care, goodbye!

34
00:02:06,202 --> 00:04:15,225
You've a room to let?

35
00:02:07,966 --> 00:04:22,754
Sorry, it's just been rented
to that lady.

36
00:02:12,096 --> 00:04:25,878
Thanks anyway.

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:04:29,963
How many of you?

38
00:02:15,905 --> 00:04:33,968
Just me and my wife.

39
00:02:17,348 --> 00:04:41,177
- Why don't you try next door?
- They've a vacant room too?

40
00:02:21,037 --> 00:04:52,871
Yes, Mr. Koo's son got married...
His room's empty.

41
00:02:27,132 --> 00:04:55,594
Thank you.

42
00:02:28,174 --> 00:05:02,082
- You're too polite. Try asking them.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:37,236 --> 00:05:16,178
This way, come on.

44
00:02:38,479 --> 00:05:19,142
Not that room!

45
00:02:40,003 --> 00:05:22,907
Oops, wrong again!

46
00:02:45,095 --> 00:05:33,960
Careful! Against the wall there.

47
00:02:52,753 --> 00:05:48,057
The little cupboard over there.

48
00:02:54,477 --> 00:05:50,780
Be careful!

49
00:02:56,522 --> 00:05:55,746
Don't break anything!

50
00:02:58,407 --> 00:05:59,991
Not on top of the radio!

51
00:03:00,893 --> 00:06:03,195
Mr. Chow...

52
00:03:02,015 --> 00:06:08,401
You have a lot of stuff
for a couple!

53
00:03:04,662 --> 00:06:13,127
- The wardrobe isn't mine.
- Wrong again?

54
00:03:06,987 --> 00:06:15,450
It goes next door.

55
00:03:08,150 --> 00:06:19,534
Okay, next door.

56
00:03:10,516 --> 00:06:28,105
These aren't my shoes!
They must go next door.

57
00:03:16,330 --> 00:06:37,876
What a coincidence!
Moving in on the same day!

58
00:03:19,738 --> 00:06:41,881
Is Mr. Chan here?

59
00:03:21,622 --> 00:06:48,369
He's working abroad.
He'll be back next week.

60
00:03:24,870 --> 00:06:53,095
You should have waited, then.

61
00:03:27,396 --> 00:06:59,182
It's too much for you on your own.

62
00:03:30,283 --> 00:07:04,628
- I can manage.
- I'll ask Amah to help.

63
00:03:32,769 --> 00:07:08,393
No need, I can manage.

64
00:03:34,653 --> 00:07:11,757
What's going on?

65
00:03:37,340 --> 00:07:16,162
Mind that mirror!

66
00:03:38,543 --> 00:07:20,487
Mrs. Chan, I'll leave you to it.

67
00:03:46,803 --> 00:07:37,308
- Those books aren't mine.
- Wrong again?

68
00:03:49,128 --> 00:07:40,672
Never mind,
just leave them there.

69
00:03:51,253 --> 00:07:46,118
Mind how you hang the mirror,
it's fragile!

70
00:03:53,539 --> 00:07:49,803
Are these magazines yours?

71
00:03:56,185 --> 00:07:55,249
Yes, they're my husband's.

72
00:03:58,350 --> 00:07:59,014
He reads Japanese?

73
00:03:59,994 --> 00:08:03,499
A little, his boss is Japanese.

74
00:04:02,239 --> 00:08:06,703
How should I address you?

75
00:04:03,843 --> 00:08:09,186
My husband's name is Chan.

76
00:04:05,126 --> 00:08:12,710
My name's Chow...
I'll leave you in peace.

77
00:04:07,051 --> 00:08:15,594
Thank you, Mr. Chow.

78
00:04:08,294 --> 00:08:18,477
Don't mention it.

79
00:04:12,103 --> 00:08:26,487
I'll ask Mrs. Chan...

80
00:04:16,313 --> 00:08:36,579
Mrs. Chan,
eat with us before you go!

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:08:41,384
No thanks,
I must dash to the airport.

82
00:04:21,205 --> 00:08:46,430
- Your husband's coming back?
- Yes.

83
00:04:23,731 --> 00:08:50,035
Then I won't keep you.

84
00:04:27,219 --> 00:08:57,003
- Going out?
- Yes.

85
00:04:31,309 --> 00:09:04,212
Sorry, I'm late!

86
00:04:32,672 --> 00:09:07,015
Amah, pour some beer.

87
00:04:35,760 --> 00:09:12,702
Cheers!

88
00:04:38,166 --> 00:09:21,593
Mrs. Chow,
try some Shanghai dishes.

89
00:04:41,373 --> 00:09:27,680
Where is Mrs. Chan off to so late?

90
00:04:45,583 --> 00:09:35,289
Meeting her husband at the airport.

91
00:04:48,190 --> 00:09:39,294
So that's why she looks different.

92
00:05:46,168 --> 00:11:36,715
It's all packed,
take care on your trip.

93
00:05:49,015 --> 00:11:39,678
I will.

94
00:05:53,185 --> 00:11:50,651
How long this time?

95
00:05:55,992 --> 00:11:54,976
Two to four weeks.

96
00:05:58,598 --> 00:12:04,428
Remember to bring back
two more of those handbags.

97
00:06:02,888 --> 00:12:06,751
Who for?

98
00:06:04,011 --> 00:12:08,993
My boss.

99
00:06:05,134 --> 00:12:11,957
Two of them?

100
00:06:06,617 --> 00:12:15,081
You know why.

101
00:06:08,181 --> 00:12:19,085
Different colors?

102
00:06:11,228 --> 00:12:26,054
The same will do! Who cares?

103
00:06:14,316 --> 00:12:30,219
Whatever!

104
00:06:26,024 --> 00:13:01,216
Mrs. Ho.
Mr. Ho is still in a meeting.

105
00:06:31,276 --> 00:13:07,624
He'll be home late...
Please don't wait to eat.

106
00:06:37,050 --> 00:13:17,636
Yes, we're so busy at the moment.

107
00:06:40,418 --> 00:13:27,487
Yes, I'll ask him to call you
when he gets back.

108
00:06:52,006 --> 00:13:46,150
Did you call my wife?

109
00:06:53,770 --> 00:13:51,596
Yes, I said you'd be back later.

110
00:06:56,978 --> 00:13:58,244
- Have you booked the restaurant?
- A table for two at eight.

111
00:07:00,065 --> 00:14:04,732
Miss Yu called
to say she's on her way.

112
00:07:03,754 --> 00:14:14,904
I'll be back after dinner,
can I bring you something?

113
00:07:08,325 --> 00:14:19,550
No thanks, I'll get my own.

114
00:07:11,453 --> 00:14:29,962
Leave when you're ready,
I'll lock up.

115
00:07:19,632 --> 00:14:42,377
- Good evening, Mr. Ho!
- Evening!

116
00:07:39,600 --> 00:15:22,505
- Going out, Mrs. Chan?
- Yes.

117
00:07:46,216 --> 00:15:33,879
Going out so late?

118
00:07:47,699 --> 00:15:37,643
Just getting some noodles.

119
00:07:49,784 --> 00:15:43,090
Amah is making pork soup, join us.

120
00:07:52,310 --> 00:15:49,097
Thanks, I'm not really hungry,
I just want some air.

121
00:07:55,518 --> 00:15:53,262
You're too polite.

122
00:07:57,443 --> 00:15:56,386
Next time!

123
00:08:01,693 --> 00:16:09,041
They're all starving, we can eat.

124
00:08:07,306 --> 00:16:16,570
Have you spoken to Ming?

125
00:08:10,113 --> 00:16:23,538
So I'll go with someone else!

126
00:08:13,561 --> 00:16:29,465
Just kidding!

127
00:08:15,726 --> 00:16:36,113
I'll be early tonight, see you soon!

128
00:08:26,352 --> 00:16:53,735
Chow!

129
00:08:27,715 --> 00:16:56,218
Coming!

130
00:08:34,932 --> 00:17:17,683
Time to go! Finish it tomorrow!

131
00:08:39,864 --> 00:17:23,130
No, I'm nearly there...

132
00:08:42,430 --> 00:17:26,013
Oh, Ming...

133
00:08:44,315 --> 00:17:32,982
- I need a few days off next month.
- Why?

134
00:08:47,723 --> 00:17:39,950
I promised my wife a trip.
Put in a word for me, will you?

135
00:08:51,372 --> 00:17:46,037
I'll speak to personnel.

136
00:08:53,858 --> 00:17:50,202
But the next lunch is on you.

137
00:08:55,943 --> 00:17:52,685
I will.

138
00:08:57,426 --> 00:17:55,649
Thanks, Ming!

139
00:09:01,556 --> 00:18:04,299
It's ready!

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:18:08,784
No, it'll switch itself off!

141
00:09:06,287 --> 00:18:15,272
I told you, it's not ready!

142
00:09:09,615 --> 00:18:22,641
A rice cooker!
It's yours, Mrs. Koo?

143
00:09:12,542 --> 00:18:32,333
No, it's beyond us!
It's Mrs. Chan's.

144
00:09:19,359 --> 00:18:40,342
My husband brought it from Japan.

145
00:09:21,043 --> 00:18:44,267
I wanted to show Mrs. Koo
how good it is.

146
00:09:23,489 --> 00:18:48,112
Now it's ready!

147
00:09:25,052 --> 00:18:50,274
Mrs. Chan...

148
00:09:34,796 --> 00:19:16,706
Could Mr. Chan get me one
next time?

149
00:09:39,327 --> 00:19:19,189
No problem!

150
00:09:40,770 --> 00:19:25,276
Mr. Chow, you should get one too!

151
00:09:43,617 --> 00:19:33,606
Your wife's so often late home.

152
00:09:48,950 --> 00:19:39,934
I couldn't trouble Mr. Chan.

153
00:09:50,914 --> 00:19:44,659
It's just neighborly, isn't it?

154
00:09:54,242 --> 00:19:53,870
It's no trouble! I'll ask him
to buy another next time.

155
00:09:58,252 --> 00:19:57,154
Thank you!

156
00:10:08,156 --> 00:20:19,822
Let's try the rice.

157
00:10:12,446 --> 00:20:29,193
Mr. Chan, sorry to trouble you
about the rice cooker.

158
00:10:15,533 --> 00:20:33,278
It was really no trouble.

159
00:10:18,500 --> 00:20:40,246
How much do I owe you?

160
00:10:21,107 --> 00:20:44,491
Your wife has already paid me.

161
00:10:23,272 --> 00:20:46,974
Really?

162
00:10:24,435 --> 00:20:50,338
She didn't tell you?

163
00:10:26,439 --> 00:20:54,343
She's been working late shifts.

164
00:10:28,123 --> 00:20:58,828
Often I'm asleep when she gets back.

165
00:10:30,369 --> 00:21:02,433
It must be hard for her.

166
00:10:32,173 --> 00:21:08,039
Yes.
Mrs. Chan isn't back yet?

167
00:10:34,980 --> 00:21:14,767
She'll be back soon...
You need to talk to her?

168
00:10:38,669 --> 00:21:19,813
A friend needs to go to Singapore.

169
00:10:40,874 --> 00:21:24,619
I wonder if she could get
a cheap ticket for him.

170
00:10:43,280 --> 00:21:28,704
I'll ask when she gets back.

171
00:10:46,247 --> 00:21:34,631
I'm bothering you too much.

172
00:10:48,292 --> 00:21:40,959
Don't mention it, we're neighbors!

173
00:10:51,940 --> 00:21:45,444
I'll leave you in peace.

174
00:10:59,639 --> 00:22:00,022
Looking for me?

175
00:11:01,082 --> 00:22:06,189
Damn right, where've you been?

176
00:11:04,531 --> 00:22:09,793
What's up?

177
00:11:06,375 --> 00:22:18,524
Mrs. Chan called,
you left a hat at her office.

178
00:11:10,304 --> 00:22:24,371
I meant to!
I wanted an excuse to go back.

179
00:11:13,392 --> 00:22:28,376
I know your tricks!

180
00:11:16,118 --> 00:22:33,422
She's married.

181
00:11:17,762 --> 00:22:37,426
I know, that's why I left.

182
00:11:19,727 --> 00:22:43,674
Otherwise I'd move in next door.

183
00:11:22,895 --> 00:22:51,283
If your wife wasn't so attractive,
she'd be a worried woman!

184
00:11:29,150 --> 00:23:00,014
I'm not like you.

185
00:11:32,798 --> 00:23:07,462
Please call Mrs. Chan for me.

186
00:11:34,843 --> 00:23:14,030
I'll pick up the hat tomorrow.
And take her to lunch!

187
00:11:38,652 --> 00:23:17,955
Dream on!

188
00:11:40,016 --> 00:23:23,722
She'll take the hat home.
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

189
00:11:43,464 --> 00:23:30,610
You're kidding!
Some buddy you are!

190
00:11:46,351 --> 00:23:35,977
Tell you what,
let's go pick her up now!

191
00:11:50,080 --> 00:23:43,426
She should be off work by now.
We can go together!

192
00:11:53,127 --> 00:23:47,671
I don't have time for this.

193
00:11:54,891 --> 00:23:49,753
Chow!

194
00:11:55,974 --> 00:23:55,120
Yes! Get out of here, I'm busy.

195
00:11:58,660 --> 00:24:00,806
Then I'll wait at your place.

196
00:12:02,910 --> 00:24:06,573
Ping!

197
00:12:12,132 --> 00:24:25,876
Mr. Chow, is Mr. Koo in?

198
00:12:14,137 --> 00:24:31,884
He's out...
Forgot to buy the paper again?

199
00:12:17,024 --> 00:24:37,330
- That's right, I'll stop by later.
- Maybe I can find it for you.

200
00:12:19,751 --> 00:24:40,694
Thank you.

201
00:12:31,459 --> 00:25:04,323
- This one?
- Yes.

202
00:12:34,265 --> 00:25:13,453
I always loved those serials,
hated to miss an episode.

203
00:12:38,034 --> 00:25:17,699
Really? You liked them too?

204
00:12:41,643 --> 00:25:24,987
I even thought of writing one!

205
00:12:43,608 --> 00:25:27,871
Why didn't you?

206
00:12:45,091 --> 00:25:33,237
I couldn't get started,
so I gave up.

207
00:12:47,738 --> 00:25:37,803
I wasn't born
to write martial arts stories!

208
00:12:50,023 --> 00:25:42,448
But you can borrow
from my collection anytime.

209
00:12:52,389 --> 00:25:48,536
Not now, maybe another time.
Thanks.

210
00:12:55,396 --> 00:25:51,980
You're welcome!

211
00:13:03,936 --> 00:26:09,120
What is it? Mrs. Chan!

212
00:13:06,182 --> 00:26:14,727
I just want to return these
to Mr. Chow. Is he in?

213
00:13:08,588 --> 00:26:19,052
He's been away for a few days.

214
00:13:10,673 --> 00:26:21,695
Why?

215
00:13:12,196 --> 00:26:25,620
They had a quarrel.

216
00:13:14,442 --> 00:26:35,312
Leave them with me,
I'll pass them back to him.

217
00:13:19,614 --> 00:26:39,156
Thank you.

218
00:13:28,876 --> 00:26:58,059
Forget it!

219
00:13:30,921 --> 00:27:05,187
I'm on a replacement shift tonight.

220
00:13:35,492 --> 00:27:12,396
Talk to you later.

221
00:13:40,985 --> 00:27:23,529
No need to pick me up!

222
00:13:45,476 --> 00:27:32,340
She's already left.

223
00:13:47,801 --> 00:27:40,109
Really? I was going
to take her out for supper.

224
00:13:51,570 --> 00:27:46,597
Didn't she tell you
she was off early today?

225
00:13:54,498 --> 00:27:52,204
She never remembers to tell me.

226
00:13:58,988 --> 00:27:59,573
Maybe she's home by now.

227
00:14:01,835 --> 00:28:06,381
- I'll be off, then.
- Okay, bye!

228
00:16:23,133 --> 00:32:45,916
Hello!

229
00:16:36,245 --> 00:33:12,588
You're out of hospital!

230
00:16:37,688 --> 00:33:17,954
Don't mention hospital!
Lend me $30!

231
00:16:40,455 --> 00:33:20,597
What for?

232
00:16:41,858 --> 00:33:24,923
You gotta help me save face!

233
00:16:43,863 --> 00:33:27,646
What's the big deal?

234
00:16:45,226 --> 00:33:30,770
It's Ah Hoi's fault.

235
00:16:46,790 --> 00:33:37,498
He gave me a racing tip,
said it was a sure thing.

236
00:16:50,639 --> 00:33:47,189
Before they'd taken out
the stitches...

237
00:16:55,010 --> 00:33:51,995
I bet everything I had.

238
00:16:57,415 --> 00:33:55,199
And I lost my shirt!

239
00:16:59,220 --> 00:33:59,524
What did you expect?

240
00:17:01,706 --> 00:34:05,131
I thought it was my lucky day.

241
00:17:03,991 --> 00:34:09,216
Anyhow, I had only $2 left.

242
00:17:06,317 --> 00:34:16,745
So I went to the whorehouse.

243
00:17:10,046 --> 00:34:20,990
You were in no shape for sex!

244
00:17:11,930 --> 00:34:26,196
I thought it would improve my luck.

245
00:17:15,940 --> 00:34:34,125
What would $2 buy you?

246
00:17:19,308 --> 00:34:42,696
I'm Kwai-fei's regular,
she gives me credit.

247
00:17:23,237 --> 00:34:46,540
You can have it on credit?

248
00:17:24,721 --> 00:34:53,989
I left my ID card and said
I'd be back to redeem it.

249
00:17:28,730 --> 00:34:59,436
I thought a few dollars
would be easy to rustle up.

250
00:17:31,337 --> 00:35:04,161
But so far nothing
I'm way overdue.

251
00:17:33,542 --> 00:35:05,763
So?

252
00:17:34,464 --> 00:35:09,928
Four Eyes was there yesterday.

253
00:17:36,429 --> 00:35:14,894
Saw her waving my ID around
in front of everyone.

254
00:17:38,915 --> 00:35:17,137
So embarrassing!

255
00:17:40,038 --> 00:35:21,462
Anyway, lend me $30!

256
00:17:48,177 --> 00:35:37,081
This is all I can spare.

257
00:17:50,583 --> 00:35:42,928
I need $1 0 for myself.

258
00:17:55,434 --> 00:35:51,819
Pay you back next month.

259
00:17:57,960 --> 00:35:57,826
- Let's have a late snack.
- What?

260
00:18:00,486 --> 00:36:03,993
All I've had today
is some won-ton noodles.

261
00:18:03,494 --> 00:36:08,318
Let me finish writing this first.

262
00:18:08,345 --> 00:36:18,971
I'm not sure
I should tell you this...

263
00:18:11,192 --> 00:36:21,534
What?

264
00:18:12,275 --> 00:36:26,660
I saw your wife
in the street yesterday.

265
00:18:14,921 --> 00:36:30,345
So what?

266
00:18:17,848 --> 00:36:39,316
She was with some guy.

267
00:18:25,426 --> 00:36:51,490
Probably a friend.

268
00:18:29,356 --> 00:37:00,621
Just thought you should know.

269
00:18:33,285 --> 00:37:09,832
Miss Yu? This is me.

270
00:18:37,415 --> 00:37:19,684
Mr. Ho's still in a meeting.
He says he can't manage dinner.

271
00:18:42,948 --> 00:37:27,133
Yes, we're very busy now.

272
00:18:48,842 --> 00:37:37,065
I will.

273
00:18:50,606 --> 00:37:42,191
I'll ask Mr. Ho to call.

274
00:18:57,784 --> 00:37:57,970
- Have you called Miss Yu?
- Yes, I have.

275
00:19:00,711 --> 00:38:00,853
What did she say?

276
00:19:01,994 --> 00:38:05,178
Asks you to call her later.

277
00:19:04,159 --> 00:38:10,144
And Mrs. Ho says she's ready
to cut her birthday cake.

278
00:19:06,645 --> 00:38:12,948
She wants you to hurry home.

279
00:19:08,048 --> 00:38:18,154
- Did you get me a present for her?
- Yes, this.

280
00:19:10,654 --> 00:38:22,079
- What is it?
- A scarf.

281
00:19:12,940 --> 00:38:28,887
- I think Mrs. Ho will like it.
- Thank you.

282
00:19:16,108 --> 00:38:31,850
And here's your change.

283
00:19:17,511 --> 00:38:38,899
I'm always troubling you,
use it for bus fare.

284
00:19:21,561 --> 00:38:44,986
Why don't you dine with us tonight?

285
00:19:24,127 --> 00:38:51,394
Thank you, I've already planned
to see a film tonight.

286
00:19:27,294 --> 00:38:55,158
Then I won't keep you.

287
00:19:29,179 --> 00:39:01,566
Tomorrow will be quiet,
take the morning off.

288
00:19:41,809 --> 00:39:24,874
Are you going out tonight?

289
00:19:45,779 --> 00:39:32,002
Don't forget your keys.

290
00:19:47,623 --> 00:39:37,369
All the neighbors
are dining out tonight.

291
00:19:50,430 --> 00:39:45,058
I have a lot to do here,
I'll be late.

292
00:20:08,754 --> 00:40:17,737
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

293
00:20:10,718 --> 00:40:20,781
I heard voices,

294
00:20:12,041 --> 00:40:25,747
I thought Mr. and Mrs. Koo
were back.

295
00:20:14,608 --> 00:40:31,754
Not yet, anything I can help with?

296
00:20:19,138 --> 00:40:39,684
No, I just wanted a chat.

297
00:20:22,547 --> 00:40:45,851
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I am.

298
00:20:27,799 --> 00:40:55,863
You're back early today!

299
00:20:30,085 --> 00:41:03,072
I came back to rest.
I'm not feeling well...

300
00:20:34,896 --> 00:41:11,722
What is it?
I have some medicines...

301
00:20:38,264 --> 00:41:19,411
Don't trouble yourself,
I'll sleep it off.

302
00:20:42,915 --> 00:41:26,940
In that case,
I'll leave you in peace.

303
00:20:51,336 --> 00:41:42,639
It was your wife.

304
00:20:55,145 --> 00:41:50,889
Have you spoken to your wife yet?

305
00:20:58,112 --> 00:41:56,656
Then we shouldn't meet any more.

306
00:21:45,706 --> 00:43:31,890
Any news from the Philippines?

307
00:21:47,710 --> 00:43:34,533
Yes, a telex.

308
00:21:49,034 --> 00:43:38,458
There's a typhoon,
so the ship's still docked.

309
00:21:51,680 --> 00:43:49,511
Please inform Chan
that the shipment may be delayed.

310
00:21:56,732 --> 00:43:53,436
Ask if that's a problem.

311
00:22:01,744 --> 00:44:06,091
Your wife rang.
You don't need to pick her up.

312
00:22:04,831 --> 00:44:09,936
She's playing mahjong with Mrs. Lau.

313
00:22:06,756 --> 00:44:15,222
She'll meet you
at the restaurant at 5.30.

314
00:22:12,209 --> 00:44:24,513
And there's a gift from Miss Yu.

315
00:22:14,214 --> 00:44:27,397
She was here?

316
00:22:15,497 --> 00:44:31,481
No, she had it sent over.

317
00:22:17,542 --> 00:44:38,290
She says she'll dine alone
since it's your birthday.

318
00:22:21,070 --> 00:44:43,896
Please phone her
when you have a moment.

319
00:22:25,361 --> 00:44:52,867
- I'll get you another coffee.
- Thank you.

320
00:22:50,260 --> 00:45:39,323
Thank you.

321
00:22:56,636 --> 00:45:53,580
That tie looks good on you.

322
00:22:58,640 --> 00:46:02,711
You noticed?
It's much like the old one.

323
00:23:04,374 --> 00:46:10,400
You notice things
if you pay attention.

324
00:23:18,528 --> 00:46:35,951
I'll be off now.

325
00:23:19,851 --> 00:46:42,599
If Chan has a problem,
let me know at the restaurant.

326
00:23:23,219 --> 00:46:47,004
I will.
Why did you change your tie?

327
00:23:25,384 --> 00:46:50,768
The new one was too showy.

328
00:23:27,269 --> 00:46:54,373
I should stick with my own.

329
00:23:29,073 --> 00:46:58,297
Don't forget to lock up.

330
00:25:13,363 --> 00:50:29,110
By the way,
haven't seen your husband lately.

331
00:25:17,052 --> 00:50:35,438
He's abroad now,
on company business.

332
00:25:20,019 --> 00:50:42,006
That's why I see you
at the noodle stall.

333
00:25:23,748 --> 00:50:47,933
I don't like cooking for myself.

334
00:25:26,514 --> 00:50:53,860
Haven't seen your wife
lately either.

335
00:25:29,802 --> 00:51:01,709
Her mother's ill,
she's at home with her.

336
00:25:34,293 --> 00:51:08,197
That explains it.

337
00:25:36,739 --> 00:51:12,122
Good night!

338
00:25:38,543 --> 00:51:14,925
Good night!

339
00:25:39,947 --> 00:51:19,731
Mrs. Chan, I'm glad you're back!

340
00:25:41,911 --> 00:51:23,255
It's raining so hard!

341
00:25:43,675 --> 00:51:27,019
I was going to look for you
with an umbrella.

342
00:25:45,881 --> 00:51:29,903
You're too kind.

343
00:25:47,003 --> 00:51:32,546
Amah, who is it?

344
00:25:48,367 --> 00:51:36,231
- It's Mrs. Chan.
- Mrs. Suen!

345
00:25:50,572 --> 00:51:45,682
Caught in the rain?
I said you could eat with us!

346
00:25:55,544 --> 00:51:51,529
Next time... Enjoy your game.

347
00:25:59,954 --> 00:52:05,225
Her husband's always away.
It's sad to see her so lonely.

348
00:26:04,686 --> 00:52:12,914
She dresses up like that
to go out for noodles?

349
00:26:19,160 --> 00:52:38,705
Mr. Chow!
What are you doing here?

350
00:26:21,887 --> 00:52:43,992
Just calling Mrs. Koo to the phone.

351
00:26:25,255 --> 00:52:49,598
You're late back.

352
00:26:26,899 --> 00:52:53,603
I went to the pictures.

353
00:26:29,305 --> 00:52:57,928
I'll be going.

354
00:26:37,965 --> 00:53:14,108
Hello?

355
00:26:39,529 --> 00:53:18,753
Yes, please hold on.

356
00:26:41,574 --> 00:53:23,639
- Who is it?
- It's for Mrs. Chan.

357
00:26:54,084 --> 00:53:51,993
It must seem odd to ask you out,
but I want to ask something.

358
00:26:58,294 --> 00:53:56,639
That handbag I saw you with
this evening...

359
00:27:00,459 --> 00:54:00,323
Where did you buy it?

360
00:27:02,825 --> 00:54:05,129
Why do you ask?

361
00:27:06,875 --> 00:54:16,583
It looked so elegant.
I want to get one for my wife.

362
00:27:12,568 --> 00:54:24,833
Mr. Chow, you're so good
to your wife!

363
00:27:15,535 --> 00:54:33,403
Not really! My wife is so fussy.

364
00:27:19,184 --> 00:54:40,692
Her birthday is some days away.
I don't know what to get her.

365
00:27:26,682 --> 00:54:54,068
Could you buy one for me
to give her?

366
00:27:29,729 --> 00:55:01,757
Maybe she wouldn't want one
just exactly the same.

367
00:27:34,942 --> 00:55:10,567
You're right,
I didn't think of that.

368
00:27:39,192 --> 00:55:17,215
A woman would mind.

369
00:27:40,836 --> 00:55:23,062
Yes, especially since
we're neighbors.

370
00:27:46,249 --> 00:55:32,834
Do they come in other colors?

371
00:27:50,499 --> 00:55:40,764
I'd have to ask my husband.

372
00:27:53,065 --> 00:55:44,128
Why?

373
00:27:55,030 --> 00:55:52,618
He bought it for me
on a business trip abroad.

374
00:27:58,558 --> 00:55:56,462
They aren't on sale here.

375
00:28:04,132 --> 00:56:07,115
Then never mind.

376
00:28:12,031 --> 00:56:22,093
Actually...

377
00:28:13,314 --> 00:56:26,579
I want to ask you something too.

378
00:28:17,363 --> 00:56:32,265
What?

379
00:28:19,729 --> 00:56:38,112
Where did you buy your tie?

380
00:28:24,019 --> 00:56:47,724
I don't know where it came from.

381
00:28:26,626 --> 00:56:52,850
My wife buys all my ties.

382
00:28:28,831 --> 00:56:55,413
Really?

383
00:28:32,039 --> 00:57:10,792
She bought this one
on a business trip abroad.

384
00:28:37,933 --> 00:57:14,876
It's not on sale here.

385
00:28:40,820 --> 00:57:20,804
What a coincidence!

386
00:28:45,110 --> 00:57:28,573
Yes.

387
00:28:51,846 --> 00:57:42,349
Actually...

388
00:28:55,535 --> 00:57:52,201
My husband has one just like it.

389
00:28:59,344 --> 00:57:59,089
He said it was a gift from his boss.

390
00:29:01,870 --> 00:58:02,854
So he wears it every day.

391
00:29:08,526 --> 00:58:17,832
And my wife has a bag
just like yours.

392
00:29:11,894 --> 00:58:22,237
I know,

393
00:29:13,458 --> 00:58:24,880
I've seen it.

394
00:29:17,187 --> 00:58:34,812
What are you getting at, actually?

395
00:29:30,899 --> 00:59:02,606
I thought I was the only one
who knew.

396
00:29:51,308 --> 00:59:41,933
I wonder how it began...

397
00:30:08,630 --> 01:00:19,658
It's late...
won't your wife complain?

398
00:30:12,960 --> 01:00:27,427
She's used to it, she doesn't care.

399
00:30:18,333 --> 01:00:35,517
And your husband?

400
00:30:20,378 --> 01:00:40,162
He must be asleep by now.

401
00:30:26,312 --> 01:00:51,616
Shall we stay out tonight?

402
00:30:34,772 --> 01:01:09,878
My husband would never say that.

403
00:30:39,544 --> 01:01:17,888
What would he say?

404
00:30:41,749 --> 01:01:23,414
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that.

405
00:30:44,716 --> 01:01:29,341
Someone must have made
the first move.

406
00:30:47,082 --> 01:01:32,946
Who else could it be?

407
00:30:53,938 --> 01:01:49,205
It's late...
won't your wife complain?

408
00:30:57,587 --> 01:01:55,613
She's used to it, she doesn't care.

409
00:31:01,436 --> 01:02:01,460
And your husband?

410
00:31:03,802 --> 01:02:06,987
He must be asleep by now.

411
00:31:26,496 --> 01:02:51,680
I can't say it.

412
00:31:32,350 --> 01:03:03,294
I understand.

413
00:31:36,320 --> 01:03:12,345
After all, it's already happened.

414
00:31:38,685 --> 01:03:18,032
It doesn't matter
who made the first move.

415
00:31:44,981 --> 01:03:29,165
Do you really know your wife?

416
00:32:15,895 --> 01:04:32,040
- You order for me.
- Why?

417
00:32:22,591 --> 01:04:44,936
I've no idea what your wife likes.

418
00:32:34,940 --> 01:05:08,724
What about your husband?

419
00:33:16,359 --> 01:06:30,422
Like it hot?

420
00:33:21,411 --> 01:06:42,036
Your wife likes hot dishes.

421
00:33:50,722 --> 01:07:41,708
Why did you call me
at the office today?

422
00:33:57,738 --> 01:07:57,166
I had nothing to do.
I wanted to hear your voice.

423
00:34:05,437 --> 01:08:13,346
You have my husband down pat.
He's a real sweet-talker.

424
00:34:34,627 --> 01:09:08,372
Why didn't you call me today?

425
00:34:37,674 --> 01:09:14,539
I was afraid you won't like it.

426
00:34:41,243 --> 01:09:20,867
Then don't call me again.

427
00:34:58,404 --> 01:09:56,830
Mrs. Chan!
A letter from your husband.

428
00:35:03,496 --> 01:10:06,361
It's not for me,
it's for Mr. Chow next door.

429
00:35:05,902 --> 01:10:15,011
The Japanese stamp made me think
it was your husband.

430
00:35:10,873 --> 01:10:19,817
So I was wrong.

431
00:35:27,994 --> 01:10:54,018
Your wife's in Japan?

432
00:35:31,523 --> 01:11:00,506
How did you know?

433
00:35:35,212 --> 01:11:09,477
What did she say in her letter?

434
00:35:37,577 --> 01:11:12,280
Nothing special.

435
00:35:40,785 --> 01:11:20,690
Anything about
when she'd be back?

436
00:35:44,193 --> 01:11:25,496
No.

437
00:35:46,318 --> 01:11:32,224
What do you think
they're doing right now?

438
00:36:23,568 --> 01:12:45,832
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

439
00:36:26,815 --> 01:12:51,920
Please pull up here!

440
00:36:29,181 --> 01:12:55,123
Why?

441
00:36:30,785 --> 01:12:59,449
I'll get off first.

442
00:36:33,351 --> 01:13:04,014
No, let me.

443
00:37:35,379 --> 01:15:09,765
- Mrs. Chan!
- Ah Ping! You're back?

444
00:37:38,467 --> 01:15:13,449
Visiting Mr. Chow?

445
00:37:39,630 --> 01:15:18,976
Yes, I thought we'd have lunch.
But he isn't well.

446
00:37:42,396 --> 01:15:25,864
- What's wrong with him?
- He's got a fever. He's all alone.

447
00:37:45,845 --> 01:15:31,150
So I'm gonna buy him
something to eat.

448
00:37:49,012 --> 01:15:35,395
The congee downstairs
is quite good.

449
00:37:50,616 --> 01:15:38,840
He doesn't want congee.

450
00:37:52,460 --> 01:15:41,883
What does he want?

451
00:37:53,864 --> 01:15:47,570
Can't taste anything,
so he wants sesame syrup.

452
00:37:56,711 --> 01:15:50,614
Damned troublesome!

453
00:38:03,527 --> 01:16:05,031
Amah!

454
00:38:05,572 --> 01:16:10,798
Mrs. Suen, she's hanging
the washing on the roof.

455
00:38:08,338 --> 01:16:16,084
- Oh, you're back.
- Yes. You've been out?

456
00:38:10,985 --> 01:16:23,133
My mother's birthday is coming up.

457
00:38:14,513 --> 01:16:27,458
So I took her to buy some fabric.

458
00:38:16,678 --> 01:16:32,424
It took all day, I'm half dead!

459
00:38:19,325 --> 01:16:37,069
And I had my hair done...
Is it nice?

460
00:38:21,490 --> 01:16:39,472
Very nice!

461
00:38:22,693 --> 01:16:42,996
What are you cooking?

462
00:38:25,098 --> 01:16:49,725
I had a sudden craving
for sesame syrup.

463
00:38:28,066 --> 01:16:55,652
That whole pot is for you?

464
00:38:31,033 --> 01:17:01,258
I thought I might as well
make a potfull.

465
00:38:34,160 --> 01:17:06,224
You're so thoughtful!

466
00:38:36,606 --> 01:17:10,950
- Please try it.
- I will.

467
00:38:39,333 --> 01:17:15,435
What a coincidence!

468
00:38:40,696 --> 01:17:18,799
Going out?

469
00:38:42,380 --> 01:17:25,207
I'll buy some noodles, I'm starving.

470
00:38:45,828 --> 01:17:28,331
Hungry? Will you join me?

471
00:38:48,234 --> 01:17:32,896
No thanks.

472
00:38:50,158 --> 01:17:37,542
Just off work?

473
00:38:51,883 --> 01:17:41,306
You must be very busy.

474
00:38:53,647 --> 01:17:47,954
Actually,
I've been to see a picture.

475
00:38:57,697 --> 01:17:52,920
Really? How was it?

476
00:38:59,701 --> 01:17:55,243
So-so.

477
00:39:01,185 --> 01:18:00,850
I used to like
going to the pictures.

478
00:39:03,430 --> 01:18:04,614
You had many hobbies before.

479
00:39:05,315 --> 01:18:11,182
On your own,
you are free to do lots of things.

480
00:39:09,084 --> 01:18:16,469
Everything changes
when you marry.

481
00:39:11,329 --> 01:18:20,714
It must be decided together...

482
00:39:13,374 --> 01:18:22,956
Right?

483
00:39:17,183 --> 01:18:35,291
I sometimes wonder
what I'd be if I hadn't married.

484
00:39:20,672 --> 01:18:39,536
Have you ever thought of that?

485
00:39:24,761 --> 01:18:45,864
Maybe happier!

486
00:39:29,453 --> 01:18:59,560
I didn't know married life
would be so complicated!

487
00:39:33,542 --> 01:19:04,206
When you're single,

488
00:39:35,146 --> 01:19:09,652
you are only responsible
to yourself.

489
00:39:38,073 --> 01:19:13,977
Once you're married,

490
00:39:40,800 --> 01:19:20,786
doing well on your own
is not enough.

491
00:39:45,250 --> 01:19:32,400
Don't brood on it,
maybe he'll be back soon.

492
00:39:52,508 --> 01:19:41,130
What about you?

493
00:39:54,272 --> 01:19:47,377
Actually, we're in the same boat.

494
00:39:59,324 --> 01:19:56,268
But I don't brood on it.

495
00:40:02,011 --> 01:20:01,554
It's not my fault.

496
00:40:04,416 --> 01:20:08,443
I can't waste time
wondering if I made mistakes.

497
00:40:07,303 --> 01:20:12,367
Life's too short for that.

498
00:40:10,350 --> 01:20:18,134
Something must change.

499
00:40:13,438 --> 01:20:24,302
So what's your plan?

500
00:40:16,565 --> 01:20:33,993
I want to write
a martial-arts serial.

501
00:40:20,896 --> 01:20:42,083
Actually, I've started one.
I'll show it to you.

502
00:40:24,144 --> 01:20:44,726
Great!

503
00:40:26,108 --> 01:20:52,175
You like them too,
so why not help me write it?

504
00:40:29,196 --> 01:20:59,304
I wouldn't know how,
I only read them!

505
00:40:32,764 --> 01:21:04,109
We could discuss it together.

506
00:40:36,253 --> 01:21:10,037
Alright, I'll try my best.

507
00:40:39,540 --> 01:21:17,005
I never thanked you
for the sesame syrup.

508
00:40:41,786 --> 01:21:23,973
There's no need,
I was making it anyway.

509
00:40:46,156 --> 01:21:33,745
Amazing! I was craving
for some sesame syrup that day.

510
00:40:50,326 --> 01:21:38,791
Really? What a coincidence!

511
00:40:52,652 --> 01:21:42,315
It really was!

512
00:40:55,900 --> 01:21:49,684
I'll go for those noodles.

513
00:43:19,243 --> 01:26:37,629
Again! Halfway through dinner,
he's drunk! Disgusting!

514
00:43:22,130 --> 01:26:43,957
I told you to stop!
What can you do?

515
00:43:32,595 --> 01:27:00,857
It's me!

516
00:43:33,758 --> 01:27:03,981
You scared me.

517
00:43:35,321 --> 01:27:07,505
How's Mr. Koo?

518
00:43:37,326 --> 01:27:11,350
Drunk, as usual.

519
00:43:47,551 --> 01:27:33,216
I didn't expect them back so early!

520
00:43:51,881 --> 01:27:43,228
Since you're trapped here,
finish the noodles.

521
00:43:58,176 --> 01:27:53,480
They'll probably go soon.

522
00:44:10,646 --> 01:28:17,829
Want some soup?

523
00:44:15,056 --> 01:28:27,040
Want some soup?

524
00:44:27,647 --> 01:28:53,792
Mrs. Suen! Playing here tonight!

525
00:44:31,055 --> 01:29:00,921
Yes, Mrs. Koo is dealing
with her husband.

526
00:44:34,262 --> 01:29:06,367
I could do that.

527
00:44:36,588 --> 01:29:11,093
No, we should not trouble you.

528
00:44:39,836 --> 01:29:17,741
Think you'll play all night?

529
00:44:42,402 --> 01:29:23,348
No, we'll just play eight rounds.

530
00:44:49,298 --> 01:29:35,602
They'll play till morning?

531
00:44:52,065 --> 01:29:42,010
Mrs. Suen says only eight rounds.

532
00:44:54,431 --> 01:29:45,534
You believe that?

533
00:45:02,049 --> 01:30:04,197
You get some rest,
I'll wake you when they leave.

534
00:45:05,938 --> 01:30:07,641
And you?

535
00:45:07,542 --> 01:30:12,447
I have a chapter to finish.

536
00:45:22,458 --> 01:30:41,281
Where have you got to?

537
00:45:24,102 --> 01:30:45,446
The drunken master just showed up.

538
00:45:26,187 --> 01:30:49,611
When did he get written in?

539
00:45:29,074 --> 01:30:54,016
Just now!

540
00:45:52,690 --> 01:31:42,875
Mr. Chow, home so early?

541
00:45:54,936 --> 01:31:48,562
- I went out to buy some food.
- No work today?

542
00:45:57,782 --> 01:31:52,406
I don't feel so good,
I'm staying home.

543
00:45:59,707 --> 01:31:57,052
A sick man shouldn't eat
all that sticky rice.

544
00:46:02,033 --> 01:32:00,656
Some of it is for later.

545
00:46:03,837 --> 01:32:04,501
Don't stuff yourself!

546
00:46:06,082 --> 01:32:07,224
Good morning!

547
00:46:07,125 --> 01:32:10,508
Good morning,
finished your game?

548
00:46:08,769 --> 01:32:21,241
No yet, but Mr. Yang has to work.
Mr. Tsai is coming to replace him.

549
00:46:15,425 --> 01:32:28,370
Did you call the office for me?

550
00:46:17,710 --> 01:32:31,093
Yes.

551
00:46:19,113 --> 01:32:34,777
What did you tell them?

552
00:46:20,918 --> 01:32:39,583
That you weren't feeling well.

553
00:46:23,845 --> 01:32:44,469
Did they ask who you were?

554
00:46:25,769 --> 01:32:46,952
No.

555
00:46:29,739 --> 01:32:57,525
Probably took me for your husband.

556
00:46:32,706 --> 01:33:03,932
Mr. Ho knows that he's away.

557
00:46:35,713 --> 01:33:08,017
Pretend he's come back.

558
00:46:45,898 --> 01:33:29,162
Maybe we're being too cautious?

559
00:46:48,143 --> 01:33:32,927
I'm always round anyway.

560
00:46:50,027 --> 01:33:37,252
We shouldn't have panicked.

561
00:46:53,516 --> 01:33:46,223
Well, they did turn up
without warning.

562
00:46:56,683 --> 01:33:50,148
What would they assume?

563
00:47:01,575 --> 01:34:00,079
One can't put a foot wrong.

564
00:47:41,591 --> 01:35:18,413
You can go!

565
00:48:06,090 --> 01:36:10,636
- Amah!
- Mrs. Chan! You're back very late!

566
00:48:09,337 --> 01:36:15,682
I had a lot of work today.

567
00:48:11,743 --> 01:36:21,129
I didn't see you leave this morning.

568
00:48:14,229 --> 01:36:25,213
I had breakfast with my mother.

569
00:48:16,274 --> 01:36:29,939
You weren't here when I left.

570
00:48:19,562 --> 01:36:34,024
Where's Mrs. Suen?

571
00:48:20,684 --> 01:36:41,553
Asleep,
she played mahjong all day.

572
00:48:24,454 --> 01:36:46,279
- Be quiet, don't wake her.
- Alright!

573
00:48:26,939 --> 01:36:50,764
Mrs. Chan, is your leg alright?

574
00:48:29,065 --> 01:36:55,089
It's these new shoes.

575
00:49:15,576 --> 01:38:28,321
Why a special dinner tonight?

576
00:49:18,262 --> 01:38:36,971
Since you won't take
your share of the writing fee...

577
00:49:23,314 --> 01:38:44,981
All I did
was give you some thoughts.

578
00:49:27,003 --> 01:38:51,789
Someone else
is asking for a serial too.

579
00:49:29,690 --> 01:38:55,554
There'll be more work soon.

580
00:49:31,534 --> 01:39:03,483
Really? So quickly?
isn't the workload too much?

581
00:49:35,584 --> 01:39:09,090
That's why
I'm looking for a new place.

582
00:49:38,391 --> 01:39:11,893
What for?

583
00:49:41,237 --> 01:39:17,500
To write in!

584
00:49:43,322 --> 01:39:23,507
It'll be more convenient.

585
00:49:45,888 --> 01:39:32,158
There's nothing between us,
but I don't want gossip.

586
00:49:51,382 --> 01:39:39,126
What do you think?

587
00:49:53,988 --> 01:39:44,893
Why waste money?

588
00:49:56,514 --> 01:39:54,344
You don't need me,
you can write on your own.

589
00:50:38,895 --> 01:41:14,200
Who do you want?

590
00:50:40,940 --> 01:41:17,804
Chow Mo-Wan?

591
00:50:42,825 --> 01:41:22,930
He hasn't been in for several days.

592
00:50:47,717 --> 01:41:31,901
We're looking for him too.

593
00:50:51,526 --> 01:41:40,071
May I know who's calling?

594
00:50:56,217 --> 01:41:48,241
Any message?

595
00:50:59,705 --> 01:41:56,090
It's no trouble, goodbye.

596
00:51:13,699 --> 01:42:23,723
Please get this to Accounts.

597
00:51:15,744 --> 01:42:29,170
And have the air-conditioner
serviced tomorrow.

598
00:51:18,470 --> 01:42:31,492
Mr. Ho!

599
00:51:20,996 --> 01:42:38,701
No need to stay
if everything's done.

600
00:51:23,242 --> 01:42:42,466
- I'll lock up.
- Yes.

601
00:51:36,553 --> 01:43:07,696
Hello?

602
00:51:42,808 --> 01:43:21,312
Where are you?

603
00:52:45,599 --> 01:45:27,063
I'll come again tomorrow.

604
00:52:48,125 --> 01:45:33,711
No need,
I'll be alright after some rest.

605
00:52:51,252 --> 01:45:38,517
It's no trouble.

606
00:52:53,899 --> 01:45:45,084
I'll bring you some food...
What would you like?

607
00:52:56,545 --> 01:45:48,208
Whatever.

608
00:52:58,550 --> 01:45:54,856
Then I'll leave now. Get some rest.

609
00:53:01,437 --> 01:45:58,861
Call me when you get home.

610
00:53:03,722 --> 01:46:05,349
Let it ring three times,
then hang up.

611
00:53:07,371 --> 01:46:08,553
Alright.

612
00:53:15,109 --> 01:46:26,014
I didn't think you'd come.

613
00:53:20,643 --> 01:46:37,227
We won't be like them.

614
00:53:24,211 --> 01:46:42,914
See you tomorrow.

615
00:55:36,408 --> 01:51:08,192
Tell me honestly...

616
00:55:40,858 --> 01:51:17,162
Do you have a mistress?

617
00:55:45,149 --> 01:51:25,573
You're crazy!

618
00:55:49,559 --> 01:51:34,143
Who told you I had?

619
00:55:51,283 --> 01:51:37,827
Never mind who.

620
00:55:53,689 --> 01:51:42,873
Do you or don't you?

621
00:55:57,939 --> 01:51:50,082
No.

622
00:56:04,234 --> 01:52:03,939
Don't lie!

623
00:56:07,322 --> 01:52:09,946
Look at me...

624
00:56:13,657 --> 01:52:24,523
I'm asking you,
do you have a mistress?

625
00:56:20,513 --> 01:52:34,776
Yes!

626
00:56:27,410 --> 01:52:49,994
That's no reaction!

627
00:56:30,056 --> 01:53:00,086
If he admits it outright,
let him have it!

628
00:56:37,674 --> 01:53:12,821
I wasn't expecting
he would admit it so easily.

629
00:56:41,764 --> 01:53:19,149
I didn't know how to react!

630
00:56:45,694 --> 01:53:25,797
One more time, alright?

631
00:57:04,098 --> 01:54:03,682
Tell me frankly...

632
00:57:07,105 --> 01:54:09,449
Do you have a mistress?

633
00:57:12,398 --> 01:54:19,381
You're crazy!

634
00:57:19,053 --> 01:54:33,238
Who told you that?

635
00:57:22,141 --> 01:54:42,449
Never mind that,
do you or don't you?

636
00:57:30,561 --> 01:54:55,104
No.

637
00:57:34,250 --> 01:55:03,354
Don't lie!

638
00:57:36,295 --> 01:55:07,599
Tell me!

639
00:57:39,061 --> 01:55:12,244
Look at me,

640
00:57:40,866 --> 01:55:16,489
do you have a mistress?

641
00:57:51,451 --> 01:55:36,593
Yes!

642
00:58:18,195 --> 01:56:31,139
Are you alright?

643
00:58:23,087 --> 01:56:42,432
I didn't expect it to hurt so much.

644
00:58:34,354 --> 01:57:05,420
This is just a rehearsal.

645
00:58:39,967 --> 01:57:16,073
He won't really admit it so readily.

646
00:58:42,533 --> 01:57:23,602
It's alright, don't take it so hard.

647
00:58:50,432 --> 01:57:36,577
You've been out a lot lately.

648
00:58:52,758 --> 01:57:39,060
Yes.

649
00:58:55,885 --> 01:57:50,594
It's right to enjoy yourself
while you're young.

650
00:59:00,456 --> 01:57:56,121
But don't overdo it.

651
00:59:05,228 --> 01:58:05,732
When will your husband be back?

652
00:59:07,553 --> 01:58:09,737
Soon!

653
00:59:10,240 --> 01:58:20,149
In future,
don't let him travel so much.

654
00:59:15,171 --> 01:58:28,159
A couple should spend time
together.

655
00:59:19,221 --> 01:58:33,285
Don't you agree?

656
00:59:22,990 --> 01:58:39,453
Good night.

657
00:59:45,043 --> 01:59:25,268
Will you come over tonight?

658
00:59:47,128 --> 01:59:27,831
What for?

659
00:59:48,411 --> 01:59:33,357
The editor's hounding me,
he says I'm too slow.

660
00:59:51,178 --> 01:59:38,483
I need your help,
when can you come?

661
00:59:54,546 --> 01:59:44,410
Not anytime soon.

662
00:59:57,272 --> 01:59:48,255
Why not?

663
00:59:59,197 --> 01:59:55,464
Mrs. Suen lectured me last night.

664
01:00:02,364 --> 01:59:58,668
What did she say?

665
01:00:03,928 --> 02:00:02,352
Rather not say.

666
01:00:05,813 --> 02:00:08,439
We shouldn't see so much
of each other.

667
01:00:18,884 --> 02:00:34,551
Mrs. Chan,
going out for noodles again?

668
01:00:21,811 --> 02:00:42,320
Not tonight,
I'll make myself something.

669
01:00:26,462 --> 02:00:55,135
Join us,
we're having vegetable won-tons!

670
01:00:32,557 --> 02:00:58,820
Alright.

671
01:02:59,589 --> 02:05:54,374
- No lunch today, Mr. Ho?
- No.

672
01:03:03,077 --> 02:06:01,583
A Mr. Chow just called for you.

673
01:03:05,563 --> 02:06:06,228
He wants you to call him back.

674
01:03:10,375 --> 02:06:13,517
Thank you.

675
01:03:43,053 --> 02:07:21,118
- Back from work?
- Yes.

676
01:03:46,942 --> 02:07:29,768
- Strange weather!
- Isn't it?

677
01:03:50,110 --> 02:07:34,093
Been here long?

678
01:03:51,834 --> 02:07:37,618
Just a while.

679
01:03:55,402 --> 02:07:45,627
I don't think it'll stop soon.

680
01:03:59,252 --> 02:07:51,234
Wait for me.

681
01:04:27,920 --> 02:08:49,704
I'll see you home.

682
01:04:29,925 --> 02:08:57,073
We'd better not be seen together.

683
01:04:34,897 --> 02:09:03,881
Then you go first.

684
01:04:38,586 --> 02:09:11,330
If they see your umbrella,

685
01:04:40,510 --> 02:09:16,136
they'll know I was with you.

686
01:04:45,041 --> 02:09:23,985
I wasn't thinking.

687
01:04:50,133 --> 02:09:36,800
You go first, I'll wait a while.

688
01:04:55,105 --> 02:09:44,169
I'll keep you company.

689
01:05:17,880 --> 02:10:29,664
Did you try to call me?

690
01:05:21,569 --> 02:10:38,314
I wasn't sure you got the message.

691
01:05:24,656 --> 02:10:44,161
Could you get me a boat ticket?

692
01:05:28,706 --> 02:10:51,450
To where?

693
01:05:31,753 --> 02:10:58,338
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore.

694
01:05:34,199 --> 02:11:05,787
They're short of staff,
he'd like me to go and help.

695
01:05:41,577 --> 02:11:17,241
How long will you stay?

696
01:05:43,541 --> 02:11:22,928
Don't know, I'll play it by ear.

697
01:05:50,879 --> 02:11:36,144
Why rush off to Singapore?

698
01:05:54,688 --> 02:11:43,112
A change of scene...

699
01:05:58,096 --> 02:11:50,961
I've had enough of the gossip.

700
01:06:01,705 --> 02:11:58,811
We know it's not true,
so why worry?

701
01:06:07,559 --> 02:12:14,029
I used to think that too,
and it didn't worry me.

702
01:06:15,297 --> 02:12:25,563
I thought we wouldn't be like them.

703
01:06:21,432 --> 02:12:36,536
But I was wrong.

704
01:06:25,803 --> 02:12:45,987
You won't leave your husband.

705
01:06:30,414 --> 02:12:54,558
So I'd rather go away.

706
01:06:38,673 --> 02:13:13,540
I didn't think
you'd fall in love with me.

707
01:06:42,202 --> 02:13:18,426
I didn't either.

708
01:06:48,737 --> 02:13:33,404
I was only curious
to know how it started.

709
01:06:52,266 --> 02:13:38,130
Now I know.

710
01:06:55,433 --> 02:13:46,219
Feelings can creep up
just like that.

711
01:07:01,568 --> 02:13:57,193
I thought I was in control.

712
01:07:04,255 --> 02:14:04,401
But I hate to think
of your husband coming home.

713
01:07:07,583 --> 02:14:08,566
I wish he'd stay away!

714
01:07:10,830 --> 02:14:14,894
I'm so bad!

715
01:07:16,003 --> 02:14:25,867
Will you do me one favor?

716
01:07:18,970 --> 02:14:30,192
What?

717
01:07:21,456 --> 02:14:36,600
I want to be prepared...

718
01:08:17,710 --> 02:16:30,016
You'd better not see me again.

719
01:08:24,206 --> 02:16:42,030
Is your husband back?

720
01:08:26,933 --> 02:16:46,676
Yes...

721
01:08:30,060 --> 02:16:53,484
Am I hopeless?

722
01:08:33,909 --> 02:17:00,612
Not really.

723
01:08:45,256 --> 02:17:24,000
I won't see you again.

724
01:08:49,346 --> 02:17:32,971
Keep a closer eye on your husband.

725
01:09:30,204 --> 02:18:53,788
Please...

726
01:09:33,011 --> 02:19:00,997
Don't be serious,
it's only a rehearsal.

727
01:09:36,539 --> 02:19:05,722
Don't cry!

728
01:09:42,193 --> 02:19:17,577
This isn't real...

729
01:10:32,072 --> 02:20:58,738
I don't want to go home tonight.

730
01:10:59,618 --> 02:21:57,608

731
01:11:04,109 --> 02:22:07,220

<i>So let's all enjoy Zhou Xuan</i>

735
01:12:59,545 --> 02:25:51,008
It's me.

736
01:13:02,111 --> 02:25:57,336
If there's an extra ticket...

737
01:13:04,998 --> 02:26:02,302
would you go with me?

738
01:15:29,184 --> 02:30:50,407
It's me.

739
01:15:31,469 --> 02:30:56,174
If there's an extra ticket...

740
01:15:33,754 --> 02:31:00,579
would you go with me?

741
01:15:46,826 --> 02:31:27,411
SINGAPORE, 1 963

742
01:15:51,838 --> 02:31:36,863
Mr. Chow has gone to work.

743
01:15:54,564 --> 02:31:41,989
Any message?

744
01:15:57,571 --> 02:31:47,836
You're welcome!

745
01:16:28,125 --> 02:32:48,308
Has anyone been in my room?

746
01:16:29,849 --> 02:32:50,471
No.

747
01:16:31,172 --> 02:32:56,158
- Something's missing.
- What?

748
01:17:02,768 --> 02:33:56,630
In the old days,

749
01:17:05,294 --> 02:34:09,686
if someone had a secret
they didn't want to share...

750
01:17:10,987 --> 02:34:14,171
You know what they did?

751
01:17:13,513 --> 02:34:19,377
Have no idea.

752
01:17:18,565 --> 02:34:30,991
They went up a mountain,
found a tree...

753
01:17:22,415 --> 02:34:37,079
Carved a hole in it...

754
01:17:24,860 --> 02:34:43,246
And whispered the secret
into the hole.

755
01:17:27,828 --> 02:34:48,773
Then they covered it with mud.

756
01:17:31,516 --> 02:35:00,066
And leave the secret there forever.

757
01:17:37,771 --> 02:35:12,241
What a pain!
I'd just go to get laid.

758
01:17:44,868 --> 02:35:21,932
Not everyone's like you!

759
01:17:47,755 --> 02:35:32,265
I'm just an average guy,
I don't have secrets like you.

760
01:17:51,925 --> 02:35:38,112
You bottle things up!

761
01:17:54,892 --> 02:35:42,037
Tell me something!

762
01:17:57,178 --> 02:35:46,362
I don't have secrets.

763
01:18:00,386 --> 02:35:53,570
Come off it, buddy!

764
01:18:03,714 --> 02:35:58,937
I won't tell anyone.

765
01:20:27,458 --> 02:40:46,401
Hello, Singapore Daily.

766
01:20:29,703 --> 02:40:50,246
Hold on.

767
01:20:32,069 --> 02:40:55,692
Mr. Chow, call for you.

768
01:20:34,234 --> 02:40:59,217
Thanks!

769
01:20:38,043 --> 02:41:06,826
Hello?

770
01:20:44,739 --> 02:41:19,881
Hello?

771
01:21:29,606 --> 02:42:51,752
HONG KONG, 1 966

772
01:21:32,814 --> 02:42:58,800
- Who is it?
- It's me.

773
01:21:36,343 --> 02:43:05,848
- Mrs. Chan, long time no see!
- Yes.

774
01:21:39,510 --> 02:43:10,894
- Amah, who's there?
- Mrs. Suen!

775
01:21:41,515 --> 02:43:15,059
What brings you here?

776
01:21:43,640 --> 02:43:18,904
It's been a while.

777
01:21:45,725 --> 02:43:26,433
I was nearby so I thought
I'd bring your boat ticket.

778
01:21:49,534 --> 02:43:29,236
And a small gift.

779
01:21:50,697 --> 02:43:35,404
You shouldn't have,
it's nice just to see you.

780
01:21:53,784 --> 02:43:39,569
The place is in such a mess!

781
01:21:55,869 --> 02:43:42,212
Already started packing?

782
01:21:57,193 --> 02:43:54,627
It's hopeless,
I can't bear to throw things away!

783
01:22:05,051 --> 02:44:01,515
Let's find you a seat.

784
01:22:10,745 --> 02:44:13,289
- Have some tea!
- Thank you!

785
01:22:13,071 --> 02:44:22,260
Eat with us, Mrs. Chan!
I'm going to the market.

786
01:22:18,804 --> 02:44:31,551
I can't, I have work waiting.

787
01:22:22,533 --> 02:44:36,517
Don't rush off!

788
01:22:24,658 --> 02:44:46,129
Mrs. Suen will be upset
if you don't eat here.

789
01:22:29,750 --> 02:44:51,415
Amah, pour me some tea too.

790
01:22:33,279 --> 02:44:57,342
How's your husband?

791
01:22:34,803 --> 02:45:01,107
He's fine, thank you.

792
01:22:36,928 --> 02:45:04,871
How long will you be away?

793
01:22:38,572 --> 02:45:08,395
I don't know.

794
01:22:40,416 --> 02:45:13,762
If I like it, I might stay!

795
01:22:43,584 --> 02:45:17,526
Why?

796
01:22:44,987 --> 02:45:28,980
My daughter worries
about the situation in Hong Kong.

797
01:22:50,721 --> 02:45:34,587
I don't want to leave.

798
01:22:53,447 --> 02:45:46,601
Since the Koos left, I don't have
my mahjong partners anymore.

799
01:22:59,983 --> 02:45:58,295
And my daughter needs help
with her kids in the US.

800
01:23:08,523 --> 02:46:08,227
What about this place?

801
01:23:10,929 --> 02:46:13,994
I'm not sure...

802
01:23:14,538 --> 02:46:21,042
I don't want to sell it.

803
01:23:18,267 --> 02:46:28,411
So I might rent it out.

804
01:23:21,194 --> 02:46:33,858
How much would you want?

805
01:23:24,241 --> 02:46:39,625
You're interested?

806
01:23:26,085 --> 02:46:48,595
You could have it at a discount.

807
01:23:30,656 --> 02:46:52,120
I'll think about it.

808
01:23:32,300 --> 02:46:55,404
Mrs. Suen, your tea!

809
01:23:35,187 --> 02:47:02,772
Who lives next door now?

810
01:23:37,874 --> 02:47:15,748
I don't really know them.

811
01:23:44,329 --> 02:47:28,243
The Koos were almost like family!

812
01:23:51,626 --> 02:47:36,733
It was so nice then, wasn't it?

813
01:23:55,355 --> 02:47:40,898
Yes.

814
01:23:57,881 --> 02:47:46,265
Let's sit over here.

815
01:24:24,465 --> 02:48:39,048
Yes?

816
01:24:25,788 --> 02:48:41,611
Is Mr. Koo in?

817
01:24:27,272 --> 02:48:47,057
He moved long ago.

818
01:24:30,720 --> 02:48:51,943
Do you know where he is?

819
01:24:33,046 --> 02:48:57,150
You know him well?

820
01:24:35,211 --> 02:49:01,475
I used to live here.

821
01:24:38,058 --> 02:49:07,482
Is Mrs. Suen still next door?

822
01:24:40,062 --> 02:49:17,574
She's gone! It's too chaotic,
everyone's running away.

823
01:24:45,836 --> 02:49:22,860
So who lives there now?

824
01:24:48,001 --> 02:49:31,511
A woman and her son.

825
01:24:52,332 --> 02:49:36,236
The kid is cute.

826
01:24:56,903 --> 02:49:50,574
No address in the Philippines...
Just his son's phone number.

827
01:25:04,722 --> 02:50:04,110
- I can't accept this!
- Please, you must.

828
01:25:08,811 --> 02:50:08,595
Thank you, then.

- Okay!
- Let's go!
